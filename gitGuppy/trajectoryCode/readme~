To run this code you need:

libraries lpSolve and fields installed in R (I can show you how to do this, it's pretty easy).
an input datafile from the video analyser (usually called something like "AviFileChunk0_View0_0_-1_out.txt")

Open "runTrajectorization.r" and set your path variables
	path = the path to your data file. All the output will go here too.
	codePath = the path to all the trajectory-analysis functions

set your infile name "infile" to whatever the name of the input datafile is.
set your output file name "outfile" to something informative (just the first part of the name: "out.csv" will get appended to it.)

Copy and paste the whole thing into R and run it. If it crashes, scream and sulk and break things (I do).
